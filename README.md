# CodeSamples
Samples of code for HollowPonds. In this repository you will find examples of different work ranging from ``` C# ``` scripts that contributed towards different games, 
to small ``` Pyhton ``` scripts which I created while teaching younger children the basics of programming. You will also find an example of an ongoing website, I am building in ```Javascript```.
 
 
### Game Projects (C#)
 
This is where my expertise is, I have spent most of my time programming games for the past 5 years. I dedicated myself to learning different techniques and cleaning up my coding practice.
I came to realise how important clean code is during my experience at my current employer where I am leading a small team of developers and artists.
By encouraging code reviews and clean code it has allowed us to pick up on any bug efficiently while knowing where to go when it comes to the location of the bug to start the debugging process.
 
 
I took samples from a few of my more recent projects such as a game jam which lasted a week that I was participating in with some friends after work hours.
This is a 3D game where the players explore islands and fly to new destinations. I was one of the two programmers on the project and set up a small editor tool within unity
to speed up the process for the level designer to implement AI agents to walk around waypoint tracks creating a feeling of immersion. 
 
I also took some system samples from two different games:
- A card game where the "DeckManager" handles the process of resetting the cards and shuffling them for the player to do their next turn.
 
- A digital escape room/ murder mystery game called  "***Gone Missing***"  that used asynchronous puzzles to solve with your friend, This game is UI based hence the large canvas manager I'm sharing with you. 
 
 
### Python Projects
 
I spent Wednesdays giving private Python lessons to 10 years old children. 
I started the sessions explaining the different variables (data types) to them using a lower language (C#)
 which visually justifies the data type making it easier for them to grasp as a concept before moving onto Python.
After grasping the different data we eventually moved onto more complicated concepts such as "If and else If" statements and operators.
 
 
#### Lessons
Here you will be able to see some of what I was teaching within my tutoring lessons and how I lay out the code. I often focused on commenting to help the students follow along with me.
While explaining in detail what I was doing, I always questionned them afterwards to make sure they understood.
 
#### ExtraSamples
Here you will find a few extra python examples I was exploring to prepare upcoming lessons I had to give to the children. 
 
### Javascript Example
 
This is an ongoing project which mostly displays the base structure of my portfolio website I am building using React for the frontend.
 
I have used a hook to trigger the menu button on and off and set up the base stylings to represent the different sections. I will look to embed some gifs and videos for each page
and then transfer that to be my main portfolio website. I opted to build it from scratch as I preferred having more control over what I am doing rather than using the template websites.
